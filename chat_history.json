    "2+5\n",
    "Let's take a close look at this simple yet important math problem.\n\nWe have two numbers: 2 and 5. Our goal is to find their sum, which means we need to add them together.\n\nTo do this, I'll ask you to imagine you have 2 apples in one hand and 5 apples in the other hand. When we combine these two groups of apples, how many apples do we have in total?\n\nThat's right! We count the apples together: 2 (in one hand) + 5 (in the other hand) = 7 apples!\n\nSo, the answer to 2+5 is... (drumroll please)... 7!\n\nDoes that make sense? Do you have any questions about this problem?"
